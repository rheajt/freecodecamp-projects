# FreeCodeCamp Projects

I started FreeCodeCamp in 2015 and it took me over a year to finish all of the various projects. [My profile](https://freecodecamp.com/rheajt) is now marked as having been _legacy_ certificates. Maybe one day I will have time to sit down and complete the updated modern challenges. Until then, I needed to clean up my [Github profile](https://github.com/rheajt).
