# Meteorite Map

fcc d3 dataviz project to display meteorite strikes borrowing from [the d3js examples](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/5193723)

- [x] User Story: I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.

- [x] User Story: I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.

- [x] User Story: I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

- [x] Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json
