#Force Directed Country map

fcc d3 dataviz project to create a force map of country flags.

I borrowed heavily from the examples at D3js.org.
[One example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045)

- [x] User Story: I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.

- [x] User Story: I can see each country's flag on its node.

- [x] Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DealPete/forceDirected/master/countries.json

- [x] Hint: You can create a spritesheet of national flags at https://www.flag-sprites.com.
