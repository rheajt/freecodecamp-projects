# timestamp microserver

[Timestamp Microserver API](https://desolate-ravine-3540.herokuapp.com/)

User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
